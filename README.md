# ImageJ-Scripts :microscope::mouse2::hospital:
A collection of ImageJ/FiJi scripts that work for me, but might not for you.
### [Tiled_ThunderSTORM.py](https://github.com/AZwetsloot/ImageJ-Scripts/blob/master/Tiled_ThunderSTORM.py)
Made for Warwick Open-source Microscope (WOSM). Could work elsewhere.

A jython bolt-on that attempts to batch process STORM/PALM stacks, apply offsets to them, and concat' into one larger tiled image.

Pop in your plugins folder to have a go. Modify the settings for ThunderSTORM at the top of the file if you fancy. 

*Requires that ThunderSTORM plugin is installed...*

### [AutoMontage.ijm](https://github.com/AZwetsloot/ImageJ-Scripts/blob/master/AutoMontage.ijm)
Automatically make two-colour montages + a merge image next to it.

Useful for processing two-colour microscopy quickly.

Example:
